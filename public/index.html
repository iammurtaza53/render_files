    Mangoes are sweet, creamy fruits that have a range of possible health benefits. They are highly popular around the world.

The mango is a tropical stone fruit and member of the drupe family. This is a type of plant food with a fleshy outer section that surrounds a shell, or pit. This pit contains a seed.

Other members of the drupe family include olives, dates, and coconuts.

There are many different kinds of mango. They vary in color, shape, flavor, and seed size. Although mango skin can be green, red, yellow, or orange, its inner flesh is mostly golden yellow.
