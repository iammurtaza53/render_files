       Specifically, states board-certified skin doctor Shereene Idriss, MD, "It's an extremolyte, which is drawn out from extremophilic bacteria. Extremolytes help protect mobile integrity in severe weather."

       Those extreme conditions, according to cosmetic chemist Krupa Koestline, include salinity, pH, drought, temperature level, and irradiation. "
